<div class="aboutSection" id="about">
    <p>The Anchor was founded in 2015 by <span>Katie Cawthorne, Laura Lethlean</span> and <span>Jessica Arthur</span>. <br>
    Through exploring the truth that comes with human emotion, the three set out to tackle subjects that are frequently judged but rarely discussed to make theatre that reconsiders forgotten or excluded stories.</p>

            <h1>The Anchor Theatre Company lends heart to the future of theatre that looks to the future and is not manacled by tradition but has learnt from it.</h1>
            <span class="cite">- Peter Wilkins, Canberra Critics Circle, November 2015.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="qblock">

    <p> Since 2015, the Anchor has produced work in Canberra, Sydney     and Melbourne on subjects including abortion, gender expectations, motherhood, legacy and drought. The Anchor uses theatre an equaliser by allowing all voices concerned to be valued and heard. The intent of each production is to increase compassion and connection within the audience.</p>
