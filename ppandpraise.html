            <p> What is a woman’s relationship to legacy? <br>
            What is a woman’s relationship to power? <br>
            And when it comes down to it, does either ambition matter in a world that we are destroying?
            <br>
            <br>
            An old statue of The Three Graces stands in a crumbling city square. Shadowed by sky scrapers and decaying car parks, the local museum curator decides it’s time the statue was brought in doors. However, the Three Graces have other plans.

            The Three Graces was produced by <a href="./Founders.html#katie"> Katie Cawthorne</a> and <a href="./Founders.html#laura"> Laura Lethlean</a> at Theatre Works, May 2019.</p>

For me, theatre’s brilliance is making you think. And The Three Graces certainly gives me a great deal to think about.”</h1>

            <p>A man and a woman meet. They’re nervous - the music is too loud - they make each other laugh - they miss the moment for their first kiss. But they make it work. They do, in their own faltering yet hopeful way, begin…
                <br>
                <br>
            This is an invitation to look back on your past loves: what you did right, what you did wrong, what you wish you could re-live and what you wish you could forget. <br>
            Short and bitter sweet, Two Hearts is for those of us who have lost love and want to find it again.
            <br>

          <p>The year after high school can feel like a loss. You feel the bottom fall out from underneath you, like everything you have learned about life up until now is… irrelevant.
            <br>
            <br>
            The year after high school is the first time you will have to structure your own life. You will go from an ordered world, the only world you have ever known, into relative chaos. You won’t have someone telling you what to do and you won’t have somewhere you need to go everyday. People will expect you to be sure of what you want, and you’ll be expected to go out into the world- you’re done now, you’re a grown up.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes you wish you could be 10 years old again, safe and happy- somewhere you can
            play and be told what time to go to bed and which books to read and what to eat- be told
            what to do all the time, where to go...
            <br>
            <br>
            But you can’t reverse time, and you know, deep down, that running backwards, running
            away, is no way to get you where you want to go.
            <br>
            <br>
            Developed collaboratively with Canberra Youth Theatre’s Company Ensemble, this highly physical play uses lyrical language to respond to the transition from childhood to adulthood.</p>
